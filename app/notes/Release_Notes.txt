^ For best results, take pictures of solid-color walls, furniture, and items. This results
  in cleaner, more vibrant colors.

*** Depending on your device’s hardware, Pick Ya Palette may take longer to generate
    color palettes. Please be patient. If you device is memory-constrained, generating
    more palettes at a time may result in memory problems.

**** It was discussed with Dr Umphress whether the lack of fragments was acceptable.
     He gave us permission to not use fragments because we had already developed the
     app-functionality in the absence of fragments.
